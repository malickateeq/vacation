RICH DAH POOR DAD

Chapter#1: THE RICH DON'T WROK FOR MONEY

“Okay, here’s my offer. I’ll teach you, but I won’t do it classroomstyle. 
You work for me, I’ll teach you. You don’t work for me, I won’t
teach you. I can teach you faster if you work, and I’m wasting my time if
you just want to sit and listen like you do in school. That’s my offer. Take
it or leave it.”

“Dad’s kind of different. He doesn’t teach like
your dad. Your mom and dad lecture a lot. My dad is quiet and a man
of few words."

“Well, you’ve never talked to me. I’ve worked for three weeks and
you have not taught me anything,” I said with a pout.
“Does teaching mean talking or a lecture?” rich dad asked.
“Well, yes,” I replied.
“That’s how they teach you in school,” he said, smiling. “But
that is not how life teaches you, and I would say that life is the best
teacher of all. Most of the time, life does not talk to you. It just sort
of pushes you around. Each push is life saying, ‘Wake up. There’s
something I want you to learn.’”
“Life pushes all of us around. Some people give up and others
fight. A few learn the lesson and move on. They welcome life pushing
them around. To these few people, it means they need and want to
learn something. They learn and move on. Most quit, and a few like
you fight.”
Rich dad continued, “Or if you’re the kind of person who has
no guts, you just give up every time life pushes you. If you’re that
kind of person, you’ll live all your life playing it safe, doing the right
things, saving yourself for some event that never happens. Then you
die a boring old man. You’ll have lots of friends who really like you
because you were such a nice hardworking guy. But the truth is that
you let life push you into submission. Deep down you were terrified
of taking risks. You really wanted to win, but the fear of losing was
greater than the excitement of winning. Deep inside, you and only
you will know you didn’t go for it. You chose to play it safe.”
“You boys are the first people who have ever asked me to teach
them how to make money. I have more than 150 employees, and not
one of them has asked me what I know about money. They ask me for
a job and a paycheck, but never to teach them about money. So most
will spend the best years of their lives working for money, not really
understanding what it is they are working for.”
Finally he said,
“You’d best change your point of view. Stop blaming me and thinking
I’m the problem. If you think I’m the problem, then you have to
change me. If you realize that you’re the problem, then you can
change yourself, learn something, and grow wiser. Most people want
everyone else in the world to change but themselves. Let me tell you,
it’s easier to change yourself than everyone else.”
“Well, if you don’t pay me more or show me more respect and
teach me, I’ll quit.”
“Well put,” rich dad said. “And that’s exactly what most people
do. They quit and go looking for another job, a better opportunity,
and higher pay, actually thinking that this will solve the problem. In
most cases, it won’t.”
Finally,
I looked up and asked, “So what will solve the problem?”
“This,” he said, leaning forward in his chair and tapping me
gently on the head. “This stuff between your ears.”

***
It was a singular point of view that made all the difference over
a lifetime.
Rich dad explained this point of view over and over, which I call
lesson number one: The poor and the middle class work for money. The
rich have money work for them.

“But don’t you feel you should pay them more?” I asked.
“I don’t have to. And besides, more money will not solve their
problems. Just look at your dad. He makes a lot of money, and he
still can’t pay his bills. Most people, given more money, only get into
more debt.”
“No, not really,” said rich dad. “If you want to learn to work for
money, then stay in school. That is a great place to learn to do that.
But if you want to learn how to have money work for you, then I will
teach you that. But only if you want to learn.”

“Wouldn’t everyone want to learn that?” I asked.
“No,” said rich dad, “simply because it’s easier to learn to work for
money, especially if fear is your primary emotion when the subject of
money is discussed.”
“How did you feel waiting in line to see me, once to get hired and
once to ask for more money?”

“Heavens no!” said rich dad. “The government always takes its
share first.”
“How do they do that?” I asked.
“Taxes,” said rich dad. “You’re taxed when you earn. You’re
taxed when you spend. You’re taxed when you save. You’re taxed
when you die.”

“As I said, there is a lot to learn. Learning how to have money work
for you is a lifetime study. Most people go to college for four years,
and their education ends. I already know that my study of money will
continue over my lifetime, simply because the more I find out, the
more I find out I need to know. Most people never study the subject.
They go to work, get their paycheck, balance their checkbooks, and
that’s it. Then they wonder why they have money problems. They think
that more money will solve the problem and don’t realize that it’s their
lack of financial education that is the problem.”

“Look,” said rich dad, “taxes are just one small section on learning
how to have money work for you. Today, I just wanted to find out if
you still have the passion to learn about money. Most people don’t.
They want to go to school, learn a profession, have fun at their work,
and earn lots of money. One day they wake up with big money
problems, and then they can’t stop working. That’s the price of only
knowing how to work for money instead of studying how to have
money work for you. So do you still have the passion to learn?”

“You heard me. Nothing. You will work the same three hours
every Saturday, but this time you will not be paid 10 cents per hour.
You said you wanted to learn to not work for money, so I’m not going
to pay you anything.”

I didn’t tell my poor dad I wasn’t being paid. He wouldn’t have
understood, and I didn’t want to try to explain something I didn’t
understand myself.

“Okay, I’ll pay you a dollar an hour,” rich dad said, with a sly grin.
Now my heart started to race. My brain was screaming, “Take it.
Take it.” I could not believe what I was hearing. Still, I said nothing."
“Okay, two dollars an hour.”
My little brain and heart nearly exploded. After all, it was 1956
and being paid $2 an hour would have made me the richest kid in
the world. I couldn’t imagine earning that kind of money. I wanted to
say yes. I wanted the deal. I could picture a new bicycle, new baseball
glove, and the adoration of my friends when I flashed some cash.
On top of that, Jimmy and his rich friends could never call me poor
again. But somehow my mouth stayed shut.

“The pattern of get up, go to work, pay bills; get up, go to work,
pay bills. People’s lives are forever controlled by two emotions: fear
and greed. Offer them more money and they continue the cycle by
increasing their spending. This is what I call the Rat Race.”

“Well, the first step is telling the truth,” said rich dad.
“We haven’t been lying,” I said.
People’s lives are
forever controlled
by two emotions:
fear and greed.

“Instead, they feel the fear of not
having money. They don’t confront it logically. They react emotionally
instead of using their heads,” rich dad said. “Then, they get a few
bucks in their hands and again, the emotions of joy, desire, and greed
take over. And again they react, instead of think.”
“So their emotions control their brain,”

“Instead of admitting the truth
about how they feel, they react to their feelings and fail to think.
They feel the fear so they go to work, hoping that money will soothe
the fear, but it doesn’t. It continues to haunt them and they return
to work, hoping again that money will calm their fears, and again it
doesn’t. Fear keeps them in this trap of working, earning money,
working, earning money, hoping the fear will go away. But every day
they get up, and that old fear wakes up with them. For millions of
people that old fear keeps them awake all night, causing a night of
turmoil and worry. So they get up and go to work, hoping that a
paycheck will kill that fear gnawing at their soul. Money is running
their lives, and they refuse to tell the truth about that. Money is in
control of their emotions and their souls.”
I just knew that I often wondered why grown-ups hurried off to
work. It did not seem like much fun, and they never looked that
happy, but something kept them going.
Rich dad said, “I want you boys to avoid that trap.
That is really what I want to teach you. Not just to be rich, because
being rich does not solve the problem.”

“No, it doesn’t. Let me explain the other emotion: desire. Some
call it greed, but I prefer desire. It’s perfectly normal to desire something
better, prettier, more fun, or exciting. So people also work for money
because of desire. They desire money for the joy they think it can buy.
But the joy that money brings is often short-lived, and they soon need
more money for more joy, more pleasure, more comfort, and more
security. So they keep working, thinking money will soothe their souls
that are troubled by fear and desire. But money can’t do that.”

“So is a poor man happier?” I asked.
“No, I don’t think so,” replied rich dad. “The avoidance of money
is just as psychotic as being attached to money.”

“I’ve met so many people who say, ‘Oh, I’m not interested in 
money.’ Yet they’ll work at a job for eight hours a day. That’s a denial of
truth. If they weren’t interested in money, then why are they working?
That kind of thinking is probably more psychotic than a person who
hoards money.”

“So what do we do?” I asked. “Not
work for money until all traces of fear
and greed are gone?”
“No, that would be a waste of time,”
said rich dad. “Emotions are what make
us human. The word ‘emotion’ stands for ‘energy in motion.’ Be
truthful about your emotions and use your mind and emotions in
your favor, not against yourself.”

“Don’t worry about what I just said. It will make more sense in
years to come. Just be an observer, not a reactor, to your emotions.
Most people do not know that it’s their emotions that are doing the
thinking. Your emotions are your emotions, but you have got to learn
to do your own thinking.”

“When a person says, ‘I need to find
a job,’ it’s most likely an emotion doing the thinking. Fear of not
having money generates that thought.”

"A job is really a short-term solution to a long-term problem.”

“I want to teach you to master the power of money, instead of
being afraid of it. They don’t teach that in school and, if you don’t
learn it, you become a slave to money.”

“You see, we’re all employees ultimately. We just work at different
levels,” said rich dad".

“How did you feel when I tempted you with a pay raise? Did you
notice your desires rising?”
We nodded our heads.
“By not giving in to your emotions, you were able to delay
your reactions and think. That is important. We will always have
emotions of fear and greed. From here on in, it’s imperative for you
to use those emotions to your advantage, and for the long term to not
let your emotions control your thinking. Most people use fear and
greed against themselves. That’s the start of ignorance. Most people
live their lives chasing paychecks, pay raises and job security because
of the emotions of desire and fear, not really questioning where those
emotion-driven thoughts are leading them. It’s just like the picture of
a donkey dragging a cart with its owner dangling a carrot just in front
of its nose. The donkey’s owner may be going where he wants to, but
the donkey is chasing an illusion. Tomorrow there will only be another
carrot for the donkey.”
“You mean the moment I picture a new baseball glove, candy and
toys, that’s like a carrot to a donkey?” Mike asked.
“Yes, and as you get older, your toys get more expensive—a new
car, a boat, and a big house to impress your friends,” said rich dad
with a smile. “Fear pushes you out the door, and desire calls to you.
That’s the trap.”

“So what’s the answer,” Mike asked.
“What intensifies fear and desire is ignorance. That is why rich
people with lots of money often have more fear the richer they get.
Money is the carrot, the illusion. If the donkey could see the whole
picture, it might rethink its choice to chase the carrot.”

He explained that once a person stops searching for information
and self-knowledge, ignorance sets in.

“Look, school is very important. You go to school to learn a skill
or profession to become a contributing member of society. Every
culture needs teachers, doctors, mechanics, artists, cooks, businesspeople,
police officers, firefighters, and soldiers. Schools train them so society
can thrive and flourish,” said rich dad. “Unfortunately, for many people
school is the end, not the beginning.”

“I’ve been a little cruel today,” said rich dad. “But I want you
to always remember this talk. I want you to always think of Mrs.
Martin. And I want you always to remember that donkey. Never
forget that fear and desire can lead you into life’s biggest trap if you’re
not aware of them controlling your thinking. To spend your life
living in fear, never exploring your dreams, is cruel. To work hard for
money, thinking that it will buy you things that will make you happy
is also cruel. To wake up in the middle of the night terrified about
paying bills is a horrible way to live. To live a life dictated by the size
of a paycheck is not really living a life. Thinking that a job makes you
secure is lying to yourself. That’s cruel, and that’s the trap I want
you to avoid. I’ve seen how money runs people’s lives. Don’t let that
happen to you. Please don’t let money run your life.”

History proves that great civilizations collapse when the gap between 
the haves and have-nots is too great.

I asked.
“In an educated society with a well-run government, prices should
actually come down. Of course, that is often only true in theory.
Prices go up because of greed and fear caused by ignorance. If schools
taught people about money, there would be more money and lower
prices. But schools focus only on teaching people to work for money,
not how to harness money’s power.”

“Yes,” said rich dad. “Learn to use your emotions to think, not
think with your emotions. When you boys mastered your emotions
by agreeing to work for free, I knew there was hope. When you again
resisted your emotions when I tempted you with more money, you
were again learning to think in spite of being emotionally charged.
That’s the first step.”

“Choosing our thoughts?” Mike asked, puzzled.
“Yes. Choosing what we think rather than reacting to our emotions.
Instead of just getting up and going to work because not having the
money to pay your bills is scaring you, ask yourself, ‘Is working harder
at this the best solution to this problem?’ Most people are too afraid to
rationally think things through and instead run out the door to a job
they hate. The Tar Baby is in control. That’s what I mean by choosing
your thoughts.”

That’s what I mean by choosing
your thoughts.”
“And how do we do that?” Mike asked.
“That’s what I will teach you. I’ll teach you to have a choice of
thoughts rather than a knee-jerk reaction, like gulping down your
morning coffee and running out the door.
“Remember what I said before: A job is only a short-term
solution to a long-term problem. Most people have only one problem
in mind, and it’s short-term. It’s the bills at the end of the month,
the Tar Baby. Money controls their lives, or should I say the fear and
ignorance about money controls it. So they do as their parents did.
They get up every day and go work for money, not taking the time to
ask the question, ‘Is there another way?’ Their emotions now control
their thinking, not their heads.”

He talked about the gold standard that America was on, and that
each dollar bill was actually a silver certificate. What concerned him
was the rumor that we would someday go off the gold standard and
our dollars would no longer be backed by something tangible.
“If that happens, boys, all hell will break loose. The poor, the
middle class, and the ignorant will have their lives ruined simply
because they will continue to believe that money is real and that the
company they work for, or the government, will look after them.”
We really did not understand what he was saying that day, but
over the years, it made more and more sense.

rich dad said, “Keep working boys, but the sooner you forget about
needing a paycheck, the easier your adult life will be. Keep using your 
brain, work for free, and soon your mind will show you ways of
making money far beyond what I could ever pay you. You will see
things that other people never see. Most people never see these
opportunities because they’re looking for money and security, so that’s
all they get. The moment you see one opportunity, you’ll see them
for the rest of your life. The moment you do that, I’ll teach you
something else. Learn this, and you’ll avoid one of life’s biggest traps.

we could never quite find someone as trustworthy
and dedicated as Mike’s sister. At an early age, we found out how hard
it was to find good staff.

Chapter#2: WHY TEACH FINANCIAL LITERACY?

In 1994, I retired at the age of 47, and my wife Kim was 37.
Retirement does not mean not working. For us, it means that, barring
unforeseen cataclysmic changes, we can work or not work, and our
wealth grows automatically, staying ahead of inflation. Our assets
are large enough to grow by themselves. It’s like planting a tree. You
water it for years, and then one day it doesn’t need you anymore. Its
roots are implanted deep enough. Then the tree provides shade for
your enjoyment.

I am concerned that too many people
are too focused on money and not on their greatest wealth, their
education. If people are prepared to be flexible, keep an open mind
and learn, they will grow richer and richer despite tough changes.
If they think money will solve problems, they will have a rough ride.
Intelligence solves problems and produces money. Money without
financial intelligence is money soon gone.

So when people ask, “Where do I get started?” or “Tell me how to
get rich quick,” they often are greatly disappointed with my answer.
I simply say to them what my rich dad said to me when I was a little
kid. “If you want to be rich, you need to be financially literate.”

Accounting is possibly the most confusing, boring subject in the
world, but if you want to be rich long-term, it could be the most
important subject. For rich dad, the question was how to take a boring
and confusing subject and teach it to kids. The answer he found was to
make it simple by teaching it in pictures.

I offer to you the same
simple line drawings Mike’s dad created for us. Though basic, those
drawings helped guide two little boys in building great sums of wealth
on a solid and deep foundation.

Rich people acquire assets. 
The poor and middle class acquire liabilities that they
think are assets.

Rule #1: You must know the difference between an asset
and a liability, and buy assets.

If you want to be rich, this is all you need to know. It is rule number
one. It is the only rule. This may sound absurdly simple, but most
people have no idea how profound this rule is. Most people struggle
financially because they do not know the difference between an asset
and a liability.
“Rich people acquire assets. The poor and middle class acquire
liabilities that they think are assets,” said rich dad.

“You mean all we need to know is what an asset is, acquire them,
and we’ll be rich?” I asked.
Rich dad nodded his head. “It’s that simple.”
“If it’s that simple, how come everyone is not rich?” I asked.
Rich dad smiled. “Because people do not know the difference
between an asset and a liability.”

As an adult, I have difficulty explaining it to other adults. The
simplicity of the idea escapes them because they have been educated
differently. They were taught by other educated professionals, such
as bankers, accountants, real estate agents, financial planners, and so
forth. The difficulty comes in asking adults to unlearn, or become 
children again. An intelligent adult often feels it is demeaning to
pay attention to simplistic definitions.

Rich dad believed in the KISS principle—Keep It Simple,
Stupid (or Keep It Super Simple)—so he kept it simple for us, and
that made our financial foundation strong.

rich dad said, “What defines an asset are not
words, but numbers. And if you can’t read the numbers, you can’t tell
an asset from a hole in the ground.” “In accounting,” rich dad would
say, “it’s not the numbers, but what the numbers are telling you. It’s just
like words. It’s not the words, but the story the words are telling you.”
“If you want to be rich, you’ve got to read and understand
numbers.”

Here is how to tell the difference between an asset and a liability.
Most accountants and financial professionals do not agree with
the definitions, but these simple drawings were the start of strong
financial foundations for two young boys.

ASSET: An asset puts money in my pocket.
LIABILITY: A liability takes money out of my pocket.

        Income Statement/Profit-and-Loss Statement

    The top part of the diagram is an Income Statement, often called
    a Profit-and-Loss Statement. It measures income and expenses: money
    in and money out. The lower part of the diagram is a Balance Sheet.
    It’s called that because it’s supposed to balance assets against liabilities.
    Many financial novices do not know the relationship between the
    Income Statement and the Balance Sheet, and it is vital to understand
    that relationship.

In 80 percent of most families, the financial story paints a picture of
hard work to get ahead. However, this effort is for naught because
they spend their lives buying liabilities instead of assets.

It is the cash flow that tells the story of how a person
handles their money.

“A fool and his money is one big party.”

There is a saying a friend of mine says
over and over to people in debt: “If you find you have dug yourself
into a hole... stop digging.”

There is some degree
of truth to the saying, “Remember the golden rule. He who has the
gold makes the rules.”

All too often, the poor and middle class allow the power of
money to control them. By simply getting up and working harder,
failing to ask themselves if what they do makes sense, they shoot 
themselves in the foot as they leave for work every morning. By not
fully understanding money, the vast majority of people allow its
awesome power to control them.
If they used the power of the mirror, they would have asked
themselves, “Does this make sense?” All too often, instead of trusting
their inner wisdom, that genius inside, most people follow the crowd.
They do things because everybody else does them. They conform,
rather than question. Often, they mindlessly repeat what they have
been told: “Diversify.”

A person can be highly educated, professionally
successful, and financially illiterate.

He was a man who did his own thinking and detested the words, “We have
to do it this way because that’s the way everyone else does it.” He also
hated the word “can’t.” If you wanted him to do something, just say,
“I don’t think you can do it.”

“An intelligent person hires people who
are more intelligent than he is.”

Why the Rich Get Richer
A review of my rich dad’s financial statement shows why the rich
get richer. The asset column generates more than enough income to
cover expenses, with the balance reinvested into the asset column. The
asset column continues to grow and, therefore, the income it produces
grows with it. The result is that the rich get richer!

Why the Middle Class Struggle
The middle class finds itself in a constant state of financial struggle.
Their primary income is through their salary. As their wages increase,
so do their taxes. Their expenses tend to increase in proportion to their
salary increase: hence, the phrase “the Rat Race.” They treat their home
as their primary asset, instead of investing in income-producing assets.

As I said at the start of this section, the most important rule
is to know the difference between an asset and a liability. Once
you understand the difference, concentrate your efforts on buying
income-generating assets. That’s the best way to get started on a path 
to becoming rich. Keep doing that, and your asset column will grow.
Keep liabilities and expenses down so more money is available to
continue pouring into the asset column. Soon the asset base will be
so deep that you can afford to look at more speculative investments:
investments that may have returns of 100 percent to infinity;
$5,000 investments that are soon turned into $1 million or more;
investments that the middle class calls “too risky.” The investment is
not risky for the financially literate.

Wealth is a person’s ability to survive so many number of days
forward—or, if I stopped working today, how long could I survive?
Unlike net worth—the difference between your assets and liabilities,
which is often filled with a person’s expensive junk and opinions of what
things are worth—this definition creates the possibility for developing
a truly accurate measurement. I could now measure and know where I
was in terms of my goal to become financially independent.


Chapter#3: MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS

The rich focus on their asset columns while
everyone else focuses on their income statements.

Today, McDonald’s is the largest single owner of real estate in
the world, owning even more than the Catholic church. McDonald’s
owns some of the most valuable intersections and street corners in
America and around the globe.

In my world, real assets fall into the following categories:
•	 Businesses that do not require my presence I own them, but
they are managed or run by other people. If I have to work
there, it’s not a business. It becomes my job.
•	 Stocks
•	 Bonds
•	 Income-generating real estate
•	 Notes (IOUs)
•	 Royalties from intellectual property such as music, scripts,
and patents
•	 Anything else that has value, produces income or appreciates,
and has a ready market

When I say mind your own business, I mean to build and keep
your asset column strong. Once a dollar goes into it, never let it come
out. Think of it this way: Once a dollar goes into your asset column, it
becomes your employee.

An important distinction is that rich people buy luxuries last, while the
poor and middle class tend to buy luxuries first.



Chapter#4: THE HISTORY OF TAXES AND THE POWER OF CORPORATIONS

The reality is that the rich are not taxed. It’s the
middle class, especially the educated upper-income middle class, who
pays for the poor.

Rich dad explained to Mike and me that originally, in England
and America, there were no taxes. Occasionally, there were temporary
taxes levied in order to pay for wars. The king or the president would
put the word out and ask everyone to “chip in.” Taxes were levied in
Britain for the fight against Napoleon from 1799 to 1816, and in
America to pay for the Civil War from 1861 to 1865.
In 1874, England made income tax a permanent levy on its citizens.
In 1913, an income tax became permanent in the United States with
the adoption of the 16th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. At one
time, Americans were anti-tax.

Yet when you study the history of taxes, an interesting perspective
emerges. As I said, the passage of taxes was only possible because the
masses believed in the Robin Hood theory of economics: Take from the
rich, and give to everyone else. The problem was that the government’s
appetite for money was so great that taxes soon needed to be levied on
the middle class, and from there it kept trickling down.

It seemed to me that the socialists ultimately penalized
themselves due to their lack of financial education. No matter what the
“take-from-the-rich” crowd came up with, the rich always found a way to
outsmart them. That is how taxes were eventually levied on the middle
class. The rich outsmarted the intellectuals solely because they understood
the power of money, a subject not taught in schools.

Once the “take-fromthe-rich” 
tax was passed, cash started flowing into government coffers.
Initially, people were happy. Money was handed out to government
workers and the rich. It went to government workers in the form of
jobs and pensions, and it went to the rich via their factories receiving
government contracts.

True capitalists used their financial knowledge to simply find an
escape. They headed back to the protection of a corporation. But
what many people who have never formed a corporation don’t know
is that a corporation is not really a thing. A corporation is merely a
file folder with some legal documents in it, sitting in some attorney’s
office and registered with a state government agency. It’s not a big
building or a factory or a group of people. A corporation is merely a
legal document that creates a legal body without a soul. Using it, the
wealth of the rich was once again protected. It was popular because
the income-tax rate of a corporation is less than the individual 
income-tax rates.

Rich dad constantly reminded
Mike and me that the biggest bully was
not the boss or the supervisor, but the
tax man. The tax man will always take
more if you let him. 

best lesson to me was: “Be smart and you won’t be pushed around as
much.”

Many employers feel that advising their workers to mind their
own business is bad for business. But for me, focusing on my own
business and developing assets made me a better employee because
I now had a purpose. I came in early and worked diligently, amassing
as much money as possible so I could invest in real estate. Hawaii
was just set to boom, and there were fortunes to be made. The more
I realized that we were in the beginning stages of a boom, the more
Xerox machines I sold. The more I sold, the more money I made
and, of course, the more deductions came out of my paycheck. It was
inspiring. I wanted out of the employee trap so badly that I worked
even harder so I could invest more. By 1978, I was consistently one
of the top five sales people at the company. I badly wanted out of the
Rat Race.
In less than three years, I was making more in my real estate
holding corporation than I was making at Xerox. And the money
I was making in my asset column in my own corporation was
money working for me, not me pounding on doors selling copiers.
My rich dad’s advice made much more sense. Soon the cash flow
from my properties was so strong that my company bought me my
first Porsche. My fellow Xerox salespeople thought I was spending
my commissions. I wasn’t. I was investing my commissions in assets.
My money was working hard to make more money. Each dollar
in my asset column was a great employee, working hard to make
more employees and buy the boss a new Porsche with before-tax
dollars. I began to work harder for Xerox. The plan was working, 
and my Porsche was the proof. By using the lessons I learned from my
rich dad, I was able to get out of the proverbial Rat Race at an early
age. It was made possible because of the strong financial knowledge I
had acquired through rich dad’s lessons.
Without this financial knowledge, which I call financial intelligence
or financial IQ, my road to financial independence would have been
much more difficult. I now teach others in the hope that I may share
my knowledge with them.


Chapter#5: THE RICH INVENT MONEY

Often in the real world, it’s not the smart
who get ahead, but the bold.

I have been teaching professionally since 1984. It has been a great
experience and a rewarding one. It is also a disturbing profession, for
I have taught thousands of individuals and I see one thing in common
in all of us, myself included. We all have tremendous potential, and
we all are blessed with gifts. Yet the one thing that holds all of us back
is some degree of self-doubt. It is not so much the lack of technical
information that holds us back, but more the lack of self-confidence.
Some are more affected than others.

Yet as a teacher, I recognized that it was excessive fear and
self-doubt that were the greatest detractors of personal genius. It
broke my heart to see students know the answers, yet lack the courage
to act on the answer. Often in the real world, it’s not the smart who
get ahead, but the bold.

In my personal experience, your financial genius requires both
technical knowledge as well as courage. If fear is too strong, the
genius is suppressed. In my classes, I strongly urge students to learn
to take risks, to be bold, and to let their genius convert that fear into
power and brilliance. It works for some and just terrifies others. I have
come to realize that for most people, when it comes to the subject of
money, they would rather play it safe. I have had to field questions
such as: “Why take risks?” “Why should I bother developing my
financial IQ?” “Why should I become financially literate?” And I
answer, “Just to have more options.”

Few people realize that
luck is created, just as money is. And if you want to be luckier and
create money instead of working hard, then your financial intelligence
is important. If you are the kind of person who is waiting for the right 
thing to happen, you might wait for a long time.

It’s like waiting for all
the traffic lights to be green for five miles before you’ll start your trip.

Rich dad occasionally reminded us of how close we
came to the secret of money on that first day we got together and began
“making money” out of plaster of paris. “The poor and middle class work
for money,” he would say. “The rich make money. The more real you
think money is, the harder you will work for it. If you can grasp the idea
that money is not real, you will grow richer faster.”

The single most powerful asset we all have is our mind. If it is
trained well, it can create enormous wealth seemingly instantaneously.
An untrained mind can also create extreme poverty that can crush a
family for generations.

The single most powerful asset we all have is our mind.
If it is trained well, it can create enormous wealth.

I have said it before, but it’s worth repeating. Financial intelligence
is made up of these four main technical skills:
1. Accounting
Accounting is financial literacy, or the ability to read
numbers. This is a vital skill if you want to build
businesses or investments.
2. Investing
Investing is the science of money making money.
3. Understanding markets
Understanding markets is the science of supply and
demand Alexander Graham Bell gave the market what it
wanted. So did Bill Gates. A $75,000 house offered for
$60,000 that cost $20,000 was also the result of seizing
an opportunity created by the market. Somebody was
buying, and someone was selling.
4. The law
The law is the awareness of accounting corporate, state and
federal regulations. I recommend playing by the rules.
It is this basic foundation, or the combination of these skills,
that is needed to be successful in the pursuit of wealth, whether it be
through the buying of small homes, apartment buildings, companies,
stocks, bonds, precious metals, baseball cards, or the like.

I use the
examples because I want you to know that it is easy. And the more
familiar you become with the four pillars of financial intelligence, the
easier it becomes.

The more sophisticated I get, the more opportunities come my way.
Another case for developing your financial intelligence over a
lifetime is simply that more opportunities are presented to you. And
the greater your financial intelligence, the easier it is to tell whether
a deal is good. It’s your intelligence that can spot a bad deal, or make
a bad deal good

It is not gambling if
you know what you’re
doing. It is gambling
if you’re just throwing
money into a deal
and praying.
